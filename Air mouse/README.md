# Air mouse project 
### Done as part of the Tinkering Lab (GE107) coursework in my 3rd semester

This folder contains the files used to control the air mouse. The weekly reports which I wrote and submitted every week to the course instructor detail the progress and information about the working of the air mouse designed.
